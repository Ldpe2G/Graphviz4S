# Graphviz4S

This project is a simply implementation of the python [Graphviz](https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz/tree/master/graphviz) library functionality in Scala.


It tries to keep the interface the same with the python [Graphviz](https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz/tree/master/graphviz) library, which facilitates the creation and rendering of graph descriptions inthe DOT_ language of the Graphviz_ graph drawing software (repo_) from Scala.

##Installation

To render the generated DOT source code, you also need to install [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php).

Make sure that the directory containing the ``dot`` executable is on your
systems' path.
